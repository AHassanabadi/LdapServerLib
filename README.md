Semi working LDAP server with pluggable backend.  
No intentions of supporting the whole RFC, just needed features like search and authentication.  
Ldap packet parser and assembler.  
  
This server can be used to support legacy applications that require an LDAP backend. The use cases are for example, authentication (Ldap bind) or user/membership lookup against an arbitrary database.
